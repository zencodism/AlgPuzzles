Python solutions for two algorithmic puzzles:
  
  * phones is test for prefix existence in list of phone numbers. List is considered 'consistent' if no phone number is prefix to any other
  * coins is denomination (money changing) problem with a twist: coin denominations are given as two values, that may be thought of as complex number. The coin value is the length of vector with these two values as x/y dimensions
