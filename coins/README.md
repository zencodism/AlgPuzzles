[number of test cases, single integer in range 0 < n <= 100 ]

For each test case:

[number of denominations 0 < m <= 40, space, target value 0 < S <= 300, both as integers, ]

For each denomination:

[a pair of integers indicating x/y values of coin in question, values have the same range as target value above]

Output data format:
  * Single integer indicating the minimum number of coins needed to reach the target value, if it is possible...
