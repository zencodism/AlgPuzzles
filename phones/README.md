Input data format:

[number of test cases, single integer]

For each test case:

[number of phone numbers to check]

For each phone number:

[single integer, up to 10 digits in original task description; the script used does not enforce this requirement]

Output:

  * 'YES' if the list has no number that is prefix to any other number
  * 'NO' otherwise

Script 'feed.sh' is terribly inefficient way of generating long list of pseudorandom numbers of desired length. Numbers are printed on standard output, so it is wise to redirect it to target file.
